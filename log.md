# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13th, 2021 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Installed anaconda, setup twitter account to log challenge progress, setup github to log challenge progress
- Planned task list for the day 2 - day 7

**Thoughts:** My filesystem needs to be more organized - files which are unecessary need to be removed to reduce clutter. I also need to pin down on a project - setting up a good profile for data science
